## Cloud-Native Developer & Infrastructure Enthusiast

I'm a junior developer with a strong focus on cloud infrastructure and enterprise application development. Currently pursuing software engineering studies at Epitech while working as a .NET Developer at Planon France, I'm passionate about creating robust, scalable cloud solutions.

### üöÄ What I'm Currently Working On

- Developing enterprise-grade integration connectors at Planon France, implementing OAuth 2.0 authentication systems for major clients
- Building a cloud-native fashion product sharing platform using AWS and microservices architecture
- Researching containerization strategies and implementing OpenTelemetry for enhanced observability
- Creating a multi-cloud deployment platform as part of my Epitech final project, including a custom Terraform provider

### üíª Technical Knowledge

- **Backend Development**: Proficient in C# and .NET ecosystem, with experience in building scalable REST APIs and microservices
- **Cloud & Infrastructure**: AWS services (ECS, Lambda, SQS, CloudWatch), Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- **Authentication & Security**: Implementation of OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect protocols with advanced security features (PKCE, state, nonce)
- **DevOps & Monitoring**: Experience with containerization, logging systems, and OpenTelemetry for observability
- **Architecture Patterns**: Microservices, Event-driven architecture, SOLID principles, and layered architecture
